Module 9 - Advanced Data Storage and Retrieval

# Overview of Analysis
The objective of this project is to create an analysis to acquire investors to invest in a new surf shop in Oahu, Hawaii. The analysis involved performing a weather analysis of to determine the temperature statistics for June and December in order to determine the sustainability of operating a surf shop year round. 

The project utilized SQLite, SQLAlchemy, and Flask to query, analyze and visualize climate data to build the business case. As part of this analysis, weather precipitation statistics such as minimum, maximum, and average temperatures in June and December and weather stations were analyzed. Flask was used to design and build a climate web application to display the information. The temperature data was converted into a Pandas DataFrame and weather statistics were gathered.

# Results
